Time-off categories:
    * Annual Leave
    * Sick Leave
    * Work Remotely

Constraint:  No two categories can overlap on the same date-range.

Requirement: When work remotely is applicable, request for annual leave should also be accommodated without breaking
constraint.

Solution:
Work-Remotely date-range will need to be modified to accommodate annual-leave.
    * If(annual_leave_start_date > work_remotely_start_date)
           split_work_remotely_from_to(fromDate: work_remote_start_date, toDate: annual_leave_start_date - 1);

    * If(annual_leave_end_date < work_remotely_end_date)
           split_work_remotely_from_to(fromDate: annual_leave_end_date+1, toDate: work_remote_end_date);

    * if(annual_leave_start_date < work_remotely_start_date && annual_leave_end_date > work_remotely_end_date)
        remove work_remotely_request;

Example:
Let's sample data inside 2 database tables from the problem statement.

Request Category:
id  name
1   Annual Leave
2   Sick Leave
3   Work Remotely

Time Off Request:
id      request_category_id     employee_id     start_date      end_date
1       3                       EMP#001         01-10-2024      20-10-2024


Assume,
    * There's already work-remotely requested for EMP#001 from Oct 1 to Oct 20, 2024.
    * Now, there's an annual leave request from Oct 10 - Oct 13, 2024.

Algorithm:
    * We will divide the date-range for work-remotely in 2 parts.
    * One before Oct 10 ( the start-date of annual-leave request). Oct 1 - Oct 9
        - If annual-leave start date comes after work-remotely start-date.

    * One after  Oct 13 ( the end-date of annual-leave request).  Oct 14- Oct 20
        - If annual-leave end date comes before work-remotely end-date.


Time off Request:   (After latest update)
id      request_category_id     employee_id     start_date      end_date
1       3                       EMP#001         01-10-2024      09-10-2024
2       3                       EMP#001         14-10-2024      20-10-2024
3       1                       EMP#001         10-10-2024      13-10-2024
